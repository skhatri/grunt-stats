# grunt-stats [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/t32k/grunt-stats.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/t32k/grunt-stats) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-stats.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-stats)

> Statics of static files using Google Analytics.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-stats --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-stats');
```

*This plugin was designed to work with Grunt 0.4.x. If you're still using grunt v0.3.x it's strongly recommended that [you upgrade](http://gruntjs.com/upgrading-from-0.3-to-0.4), but in case you can't please use [v0.3.2](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cssmin/tree/grunt-0.3-stable).*
